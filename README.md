### Objectives

- Exploratory data analysis & visualization.
- Identify the releationship between each attributes.
- Use feature engineering techniques to develop the model. 
- Implement classification model & use hyper-parameter techniques to increase the accuracy.
- Evaluate the model.
- Deploy developed model in Heroku cloud platform using Flask web framework ( as a flask web application ).
